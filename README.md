## About The Project

This repository hosts a classic number guessing game, a foundational project that demonstrates core principles of front-end web development. The application challenges players to guess a randomly generated integer between 1 and 100 within a limited number of ten attempts. It serves as an interactive showcase of event handling, DOM manipulation, and fundamental game logic.

The gameplay is straightforward yet compelling. Upon loading, the application silently selects a secret number. As the player enters their guesses, the game provides immediate, intuitive feedback, informing them whether their guess was too high or too low. The interface dynamically updates to display a running list of previous guesses and a countdown of the remaining attempts.

## Key Features

* **Random Number Generation**: A new secret number between 1 and 100 is generated for each game.
* **Limited Attempts**: Players have 10 tries to find the correct number.
* **Interactive Feedback**: Instant "Too high" or "Too low" hints guide the player.
* **State Tracking**: Displays previous guesses and the number of attempts remaining.
* **Input Validation**: Ensures only valid numbers within the correct range are submitted.
* **Play Again**: A seamless option to start a new game after winning or losing.
